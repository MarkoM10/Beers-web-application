#Simple Beers shop web application

Hi! This is one of my first ReactJS projects and I am very excited to share it here. I made a simple Web page/Web application using HTML, CSS, JS, and ReactJS with the example of API data fetching. The project is pretty much a simple webshop with basic functionalities such as: 

1) Pagination
2) Sorting and searching API data 
3) Adding products to the cart and removing them 
4) Calculating total price, product quantity, and cart quantity
5) Storing cart quantity in local storage
6) Showing spinner after the pay button was clicked

My main goal in this project was to learn how the fetching of API data is done. Besides that I wanted to get familiar with React as much as possible, especially with: Context, UseEffect, Browser Router and other basic React concepts.
